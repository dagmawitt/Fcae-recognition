# Fcae-recognition
This project focuses on face recognition through the use of the SVM machine learning algorithm. Specifically, we conducted a comparison of three different SVM models: Linear SVM, Kernel SVM, and Poly SVM. Our aim was to determine which model would yield the most accurate results in identifying faces.

To achieve this, we utilized a dataset of facial images and trained each SVM model on this data. We then tested the models on a separate set of images to evaluate their performance.
